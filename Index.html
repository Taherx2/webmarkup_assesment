<header><strong>Victron 175Wp 12Volt Solar panel set</strong></header>
<p> A 12 volt solar set, that can be installed on campers, boat & garden houses. Set Includes a steca solarix 2525 and 4040 are newly developed products based on the internationally renowned controller family Steca PR. With increased module and load current, the controllers are now also suitable for even larger systems. The devices also feature an integrated USB charging port for charging smartphones and tablets.
Use of the latest charging technologies combined with state of charge determination enable optimal battery maintenance and module power monitoring. A large display informs the user about all operating modes with the aid of symbols. The state of charge is represented visually as a level meter. Data such as voltage, current and state of charge can also be displayed digitally as figures on the display. In addition, the controller has an energy meter which can be reset by the user.

<strong>Victron EasySolar 24/3000/70-50 MPPT 150/70 Color Control</strong>
</header>
<p>The all-in-one solar power solution
The EasySolar combines a MPPT solar charge controller, an inverter/charger and AC distribution
in one enclosure.
The product is easy to install, with a minimum of wiring.Color Control panel
Two outstanding functions:
- Prioritizes battery charging by the MPPT charge controller
- Connects to the internet, enabling remote monitoring (VRM website) and remote control.
AC distribution
The AC distribution consists of a RCD (30mA / 63A) and four AC outputs protected by two 10A
and two 16A circuit breakers. An additional 16A output is controlled by the AC input: it will switch on only when AC is available.
PowerAssist Unique PowerAssist technology protects the utility or generator supply from being overloaded by adding extra inverter power when needed.<a href = "http://www.ikwilzonneenergie.nl/Victron-EasySolar-24V-3000W-70A-50-MPPT-Color-Control"> more info</a></p>

<strong>Victron Multiplus 12V/3000W/120-16</strong>
</header>
<p>The multiplus is a combined inverter and charger in one simple and beautifully designed package. Features include a true sine wave inverter, adaptive charging, hybrid PowerAssist technology, plus multiple system integration features.
the multiplus has a unique powerassist feature that prevents overloads from an ac source such as a generator or a shore power connection. the multiplus begins by automatically reducing the the battery charge when otherwise the overload 
would occur and is followed up by supplying the output of the generator with power taken from the battery.</p>
<p>The multiplus also provides an uninterrupted  ac power source.In the event of a grid failure, or when shore or generator power is disconnected, the inverter within the Multi is automatically activated and takes over the supply to the connected loads.
 This happens so fast (less than 20 milliseconds) that computers and other electronic equipment will continue to operate without disruption.<a href ="http://www.ikwilzonneenergie.nl/Victron-Energy-Multiplus-12V/3000W/120-16">More info</a></p>
